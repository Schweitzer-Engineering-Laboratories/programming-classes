# Get Started With Python

Welcome to Python!

Python is a versatile (lots of modules focused on specific tasks),
easy-to-learn (syntax reads like English) programming language supported by
an active community within SEL (see the SEL Code Club Team or the Python channel
on the Development Team) and the world (see python.org and stackexchange.com).

#### Quick Start
This is an interactive newcomer's orientation to Python. SEL employees enroll
in the class on Workday.

#### Segments
Each Jupyter Notebook in this directory is a class activity:

1. `hello_world.ipynb`: Write your first Python script. Use `print()`,
   `for ...`, and `range()`.
2. `user_input.ipynb`: Query and print user input. Use `input()`, `if ...`,
   and construct objects from objects of different type.
3. `lists.ipynb`: Build and use `list`s in different ways. Use `append()`,
   `count()`, `sort()`, slicing, and other list methods and functions.
