# Start Programming With Python

Welcome to Python!

Python is a versatile (lots of modules focused on specific tasks),
easy-to-learn (syntax reads like English) programming language supported by
an active community within SEL (see the SEL Code Club Team or the Python channel
on the Development Team) and the world (see python.org and stackexchange.com).

This class if for new programmers. If you already have extensive experience
writing code in some language, you may prefer the more advanced overview,
[Python for Programmers](../PythonForProgrammers/README.md).

#### Quick Start
SEL employees enroll in the class on Workday.

#### Contents
Each Jupyter Notebook in this directory is a class activity, building in
sequence:

1. [1-hello_world.ipynb](1-hello_world.ipynb):
   Write your first Python script. Use `print()`, `for ...`, and `range()`.
2. [2-user_input.ipynb](2-user_input.ipynb):
   Query and print user input. Use `input()`, `if ...`,
   and construct objects from objects of different type.
3. [3-lists.ipynb](3-lists.ipynb):
   Build and use `list`s in different ways. Use `append()`,
   `count()`, `sort()`, slicing, and other list methods and functions.

In addition, [0-reference.ipynb](0-reference.ipynb) provides an introduction to
Jupyter Notebooks.

Find examples of working Jupyter Notebooks in the `examples` directory
(solving real-world problems), and in the `projects` directory (showing past
participants' final projects).
