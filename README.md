# SEL Programming Classes
This repository contains the interactive materials, i.e.
scripts/assignments/examples, for programming classes designed and hosted at
SEL.

Contact: Brett Deaton, STEM Fundamentals program


### Course Catalog

**Getting Started with Python.** An active orientation to Python using Jupyter
Notebooks. The audience is anyone with little to no programming experience.
When done, participants will be able to run, modify, and write simple scripts
using basic syntax like `print`, `for`-loops, `if`-statements, `input`,
and put a `list` to work through its methods and Python's built-in functions.


### Quick Start For Class Participants
If your class is run through a cloud based interpreter like
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/), you may be interacting with this code through
a server and won't need to download a local copy at all.

If you do want the code on your local machine:
1. Download zip of this repository.
2. Navigate to `<yourclass>` directory.
3. Follow the instructions in `<yourclass>/README.md`.

Or for an updateable copy with the entire version history, follow the
instructions for `git clone` below.


### Quick Start For Contributors
If you want to create a new or improve an old SEL programming class reach out.
We'd love your ideas! To join the development team:
1. Create your own github account with conventional handle `<username>SEL`.
2. Request an invite to the organization `Schweitzer-Engineering-Laboratories`
   (contact Thomas Benda, Jason Kemp).
3. Request write access to this repository (contact Brett Deaton).
4. Clone this repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/Schweitzer-Engineering-Laboratories/programming-classes.git`
5. Develop using the git workflow: add/remove/modify files > `git add` >
   `git commit` > `git push`.
   Keep your commits small (e.g. a few hours of work) and coherent (e.g. avoid
   commits that solve multiple unrelated issues or break working code),
   and make your commit messages clear and concise.


### Conventions
Create new classes in the root directory using a short name.

Add a short class description to [Course Catalog](#course-catalog) above for
each new class.

Create a `README` file in each course root directory describing the course
simply, including information common to other `README`s

Store images in `images` directory at the root level for each course.
