# Python for Programmers

Welcome to a deeper look at Python!

This is an active overview of Python's core language
features, data structures, and object model.
When done, participants will be able to use common data structures
like lists, sets, and dictionaries. They will be able to define and use
functions (including with default, keyword, and variable parameter sets),
classes (including creating new types that interface with built-in functions),
and modules (both defining your own and importing others). Class examples
reveal the power and limits of the "Pythonic" idiom.

This class is for programmers. If you're able to write code in some language,
using control flow (if/else, loops), functions, and ideally classes, to solve a
problem, e.g. "given an input string like this paragraph, generate a count of
the number of times the word 'is' is used."
If that doesn't describe you, you'll want
to spend some time coding before you take this class. A great place to start is
our introductory Python class,
[Start Programming With Python](../StartProgrammingPython/README.md).

#### Quick Start
SEL employees enroll in the class on Workday.

#### Contents
These Jupyter Notebooks are a sandbox of examples we'll walk through in class.
They can also serve as a start to your own notes for reference. Class has two
segments: 1) overview, and 2) data structures & organizing concepts.

0. [0-reference.ipynb](0-reference.ipynb):
   Collection of commonly-used code structures and Q&As related to this course.
1. [1-overview.ipynb](1-overview.ipynb):
   Practice using core features of the language: keywords and operators,
   comments and docstrings, indentation, NoneType, strong dynamic typing,
   simple vs compound statements, conditionals, truthiness, ducktyping,
   built-in functions, magic methods, the object model, scope, garbage
   collection, passing parameters by object reference, what "Pythonic" means.
2. [2-data_structures_and_organizing_concepts.ipynb](2-data_structures_and_organizing_concepts.ipynb):
   Build and manipulate common data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples,
   strings, and sets. Distinguish types that are immutable/hashable or
   ordered/indexed. Specify slices and loop over container classes.
   Define and call functions with default parameters, keyword parameters,
   and variable parameter lists. Create your own classes with the unique
   data structure and functionality you need to solve your problems,
   employing magic methods for construction and polymorphism. Organize
   your problem's object model using inheritance.

In addition, [0-quick_start.ipynb](0-quick_start.ipynb) provides a quick
look at some of the common idioms sprinkled widely through the Notebooks above
like printing string representations of objects, importing
modules/packages/libraries, inspecting an object's interface, accessing the
documentation, formatting strings.
