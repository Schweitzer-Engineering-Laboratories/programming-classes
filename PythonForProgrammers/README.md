# Python for Programmers

Welcome to Python!

Python is a versatile (lots of modules focused on specific tasks),
easy-to-learn (syntax reads like English) programming language supported by
an active community within SEL (see the SEL Code Club Team or the Python channel
on the Development Team) and the world (see python.org and stackexchange.com).

#### Quick Start
This is an interactive programmer's overview of Python. SEL employees enroll
in the class on Workday.

#### Contents
These Jupyter Notebooks are a sandbox of examples we'll walk through in class.
They can also serve as a start to your own notes for reference. Class has two
segments: 1) overview, and 2) data structures & organizing concepts.

1. [1-overview.ipynb](1-overview.ipynb):
   Practice using core features of the language: keywords and operators,
   comments and docstrings, indentation, NoneType, strong dynamic typing,
   simple vs compound statements, conditionals, truthiness, ducktyping,
   built-in functions, magic methods, the object model, scope, garbage
   collection, passing parameters by object reference, what "Pythonic" means.
2. [2-data_structures_and_organizing_concepts.ipynb](2-data_structures_and_organizing_concepts.ipynb):
   Build and manipulate common data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples,
   strings, and sets. Distinguish types that are immutable/hashable or
   ordered/indexed. Specify slices and loop over container classes.
   Define and call functions with default parameters, keyword parameters,
   and variable parameter lists. Create your own classes with the unique
   data structure and functionality you need to solve your problems,
   employing magic methods for construction and polymorphism. Organize
   your problem's object model using inheritance.

In addition, [0-quick_start.ipynb](0-quick_start.ipynb) provides a quick
look at some of the common idioms sprinkled widely through the Notebooks above
like printing string representations of objects, importing
modules/packages/libraries, inspecting an object's interface, accessing the
documentation, formatting strings.
